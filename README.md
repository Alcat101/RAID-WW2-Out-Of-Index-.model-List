# RAID-WW2-Out-Of-Index-.model-List
This repo has one purpose, it is meant to be more of a information for the model porters to be aware of this issue. This repo is for listing out all the .models that are corrupted due to Out of Index on export. 

Not only this information will be helpful to others but it'll also show the flaws with the current model tool.

-List of corrupted .model's has been created by me
